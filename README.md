# Airbnb Listings

Simple static demo showing Airbnb listings (San Francisco subset).

Contents
- `index.html` — main page that renders the listings.
- `css/main.css` — styles (uses Bootstrap CDN).
- `js/main.js` — client-side code: loads `airbnb_sf_listings_500.json` and renders cards; opens a details modal.
- `airbnb_sf_listings_500.json` — dataset (sample of Airbnb listings).
